generate a blockchain token protocol to reward gamers according to data consumption
Suppose a game consume 5 gb data when one player is playing the game . Can this 5 gb data consumption can be tokenised and can be on blockchain ?
I want to convert that 5 gb data consumption as mining of a new blockchain token 
someone can inflate data consumption; can you explain how ? And how can that be controlled ?
want a layer 1 blockchain for this that can be integrated with any outside app or website. Is this possible?
The blockchain have to mine 1.05  token for each byte; And token itself will be in byte like 100 MB 120 byte 300 kilobyte or 5 GB or 5 TB
1.05 will be mined against each byte ; but player will get exact amount of token  .025 will go to validator/transaction fees & .025 go to administrator/governanace
need Consensus Algorithm , Smart Contract
